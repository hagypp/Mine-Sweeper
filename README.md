Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game that involves finding and marking all of the mines hidden on a grid of squares. The rules of the game are as follows:

The game is played on a grid of squares, some of which contain mines. The size of the grid and the number of mines can vary, but typically there are more empty squares than mines.

The player clicks on a square to reveal what is hidden beneath it. If the square contains a mine, the player loses the game. If the square is empty, a number will be revealed indicating how many mines are in the surrounding eight squares.

The player can use this information to deduce where the mines are located and mark them with a flag.

The game is won when all of the mines have been successfully marked.

The player can also right-click on a square to mark it with a question mark, indicating that they are unsure whether it contains a mine. This can be helpful for keeping track of squares that the player wants to revisit later.
